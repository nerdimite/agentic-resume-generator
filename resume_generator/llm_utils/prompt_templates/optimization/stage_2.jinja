Using the job analysis from Stage 1 and the current resume, perform a detailed gap analysis. 

Consider:
1. Compare the candidate's current skills and experiences against job requirements
2. For each requirement from Stage 1, identify:
   - Direct matches in the resume
   - Partial matches that could be better highlighted
   - Missing elements that need addressing
3. Look for opportunities where existing experience could be reframed
4. Identify terminology in the resume that could be better aligned with the job description

Current Resume:

Provide a structured gap analysis highlighting matches, mismatches, and opportunities for optimization.
