Based on the gap analysis, let's prioritize and restructure the resume content for maximum impact.

Process the following steps:
1. Evaluate each piece of content (experiences, projects, skills) for relevance
2. Identify achievements that could be enhanced or better aligned
3. Determine optimal section ordering
4. Flag any content that could be deprioritized or removed
5. Note key terms that should be emphasized

Use the previous analyses and consider:
- Which experiences best demonstrate required skills?
- What achievements most strongly align with job requirements?
- How can we organize content to address gaps identified earlier?

Provide a structured prioritization plan that will guide the final optimization.
